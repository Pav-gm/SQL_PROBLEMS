# Solution Explanation: Median Given Frequency of Numbers

## Purpose

This solution calculates the median of a set of numbers where each number has a given frequency. The script decompresses the numbers based on their frequencies and then computes the median.

## Why Decompress the Numbers?

- The frequencies provide a compressed representation of the dataset.
- Decompressing allows us to accurately calculate the median as if we had the full dataset.

## How It Works

1. **Decompress the Numbers**
   - A Common Table Expression (CTE) is used to generate the full set of numbers based on their frequencies.
   - The CTE uses a recursive approach to expand each number according to its frequency.

2. **Calculate the Median**
   - The median is calculated by combining two subqueries:
     - One subquery finds the maximum number from the first half of the decompressed dataset.
     - The other subquery finds the minimum number from the second half of the decompressed dataset.
   - These values are then averaged to find the median.

## Detailed Steps

1. **Decompress the Numbers**
   - The CTE starts by selecting each number from the table with an initial frequency of 1.
   - The recursive part of the CTE increments the frequency for each number until it reaches its specified value, effectively expanding the numbers.

2. **Calculate the Median**
   - A subquery selects the maximum number from the first half of the ordered decompressed dataset.
   - Another subquery selects the minimum number from the first half of the ordered decompressed dataset in descending order.
   - The results from the two subqueries are added together, cast to a float, rounded to one decimal place, and then divided by 2 to find the median.

## Conclusion

This solution effectively handles the calculation of the median from a compressed frequency-based dataset by:
- Decompressing the dataset using a recursive CTE.
- Calculating the median using appropriate subqueries and arithmetic operations.

This method ensures accurate calculation of the median even when dealing with large datasets where direct calculation might be computationally expensive.
