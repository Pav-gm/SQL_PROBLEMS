# SQL Challenges on LeetCode

## About This Repository

Welcome to my collection of SQL challenges from LeetCode! This repository is a curated showcase of my journey in mastering SQL through various interesting and challenging problems I've encountered and solved on LeetCode. It serves as a testament to my growing skills in database management, query optimization, and data analysis.

## My Journey with SQL

Embarking on these challenges has significantly enhanced my SQL skills. This journey has been about more than just learning syntax; it's about understanding how to efficiently retrieve and manipulate data, optimize queries, and solve real-world data problems.

## Repository Structure

Each folder within this repository corresponds to a specific SQL problem from LeetCode. Inside each, you'll find:
- `problem_statement.md`: A detailed description of the problem.
- `solution.sql`: My SQL solution to the problem.
- `discussion.md`: An analysis of the problem, the rationale behind my solution, its efficiency, and any alternate approaches considered.

## Problem Categories

The problems are grouped based on their difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and the key SQL concepts they explore, such as:
- Joins and Subqueries
- Aggregation Functions
- Window Functions
- Data Manipulation and Transformation
- Complex Query Optimization
